/*
 *  workspace++
 *
 *  c++ version of workspace utility
 *  a workspace is a temporary directory created in behalf of a user with a limited lifetime.
 *  This version is not DB and configuration compatible with the older version, the DB and
 *  configuration was changed to YAML files.
 *
 *  differences to old workspace version
 *    - usage of YAML file format
 *    - using setuid or capabilities (needs support by filesystem!)
 *    - always moves released workspace away (this change is affecting the user!)
